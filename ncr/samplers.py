    dataset.
    Parameters/Attributes
    ----------
    data : the dataset fold for which the batches have to be created.
    n_neg_samples: number of negative samples that have to be generated for each interaction (during training should be
    one, while in validation and test should be 100 (these are the specs reported in the paper))
    user_item_matrix: this is a scipy sparse matrix containing the user-item interactions in the dataset. This is needed
    for the sampling of negative items.
    batch_size : the size of the batches, by default 1.
    shuffle : whether the data set must by randomly shuffled before creating the batches, by default ``True``
    seed: the random seed for the shuffle
    device: the device where the torch tensors have to be put
